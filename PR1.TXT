HyperAct releases WebApp : Web server applications, the RAD way!
For Delphi 2, Delphi 3 and C++Builder

DES MOINES, IOWA, April 24, 1997 - HyperAct, Inc., a leading provider of Web tools 
and Applications, announced WebApp, a new and exciting framework that provides web 
programmers with the building blocks they need to build great web applications today!

WEBAPP FEATURES :
* Server Independent - a WebApp Server Application can run unmodified, without 
  re-compilation, on top of any Web server!
* Automatic Session Management - The WebApp framework implements transparent 
  cookies-based session state management, keeping track of your users for you.
* High performance - WebApp Server Applications are fully multi-threaded, employing 
  thread pooling to maximize the utilization of the server resources. 
* Safe - WebApp Server Applications run in a separate process from the server, 
  eliminating the risk for a server crash!
* Easy Debugging - Live WebApp applications can be debugged easily from within the 
  Delphi or C++Builder environment, without requiring a restart of the server. 

Here's what the professionals have to say about WebApp :

   "I have already fallen in love with WebApp. This is just too cool. Delphi 3 makes 
   ISAPI development much easier but why would I bang my head against the wall when 
   I can have session management and all the other goodies that WebApp gives me?" 

   Stephen Genusa - Consultant, maintainer of IIS, ASP and ISAPI FAQs, author of Que’s 
   Special Edition Using ISAPI. 

WebApp applications run on top of any web server, using the server's native interface. 
WebApp ships with native support for Microsoft Internet Information Server (ISAPI), 
Microsoft Personal Web Server (ISAPI), Netscape FastTrack (NSAPI), O'reilly WebSite and 
WebSite Pro (WSAPI), as well as CGI and Win-CGI interfaces which will work with any web 
server!

Put this great technology to work using WebApp's simple object model (similar to and 
compatible with the model used in Microsoft Active Server Pages). To get you started 
as quickly as possible, we've included a variety of common components and sample 
applications, including:

* Browser Capabilities component, providing your applications with a description of 
  the capabilities of the client's web browser
* Ad Rotator component, providing automated, controlled rotation of advertisement images.
* HTML generation components and functions, simplifying the generation of complex HTML 
  constructs, including generation of HTML tables from DB tables and queries.
* Coming soon - integrated HTML template preprocessor with embedded scripting language!
