<p>DES MOINES, IOWA, <strong>July 17, 1997</strong> - HyperAct,
Inc., a leading provider of Web tools and applications, released
another Preview (#5) of WebApp, a new and exciting framework that
provides web programmers with the building blocks they need to
build great web applications today!</p>

<h3>New in Preview 5 :</h3>

<p>Preview 5 is the final preview before the release of WebApp!</p>

<p>Here are the new features in this release :</p>

<ul>
    <li>Data-aware versions of the HTML controls</li>
    <li>New extendible architecture for Web-aware components</li>
    <li>Automatic triggering of actions by various parameters
        such as the requested URL, or by the action name.</li>
    <li>Enhanced HTML templates syntax enables activation of
        components and modification of component properties
        directly from the HTML template</li>
    <li>Enhanced debugging support</li>
    <li>Support for mapping URLs to Applications, as well as
        support for a default AppID.</li>
    <li>Customization of error messages</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of you have expressed interest in a sending email from
your WebApp applications. To provide the best solution possible,
we have licensed the <strong>TSMTP</strong> component from <strong>ArGo
Software</strong>, the makers of IMS, and will integrate this
component with the Pro version of WebApp. </p>

<h3>Pricing :</h3>

<h3>WebApp Features :</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Server Independent</strong> - a WebApp Server
        Application can run unmodified, without re-compilation,
        on top of any Web server!</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Session Management</strong> - The
        WebApp framework implements transparent cookies-based
        session state management, keeping track of your users for
        you.</li>
    <li><strong>High performance</strong> - WebApp Server
        Applications are fully multi-threaded, employing thread
        pooling to maximize the utilization of the server
        resources. The thread management is optimized for
        BDE-based Delphi applications. </li>
    <li><strong>Safe</strong> - WebApp Server Applications run in
        a separate process from the server, eliminating the risk
        for a server crash!</li>
    <li><strong>Easy Debugging</strong> - Live WebApp
        applications can be debugged easily from within the
        Delphi or C++Builder environment, without requiring a
        restart of the server. </li>
    <li><strong>HTML Templates</strong> - WebApp provides
        integrated support for HTML templates, facilitating
        separation between the application logic and the HTML
        Fronted.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-side Scripts </strong>- WebApp templates
        are driven with inlined VBScript and JScript scripts,
        providing unparalleled power and flexibility to the
        template authors and easy integration with the WebApp
        Delphi / CBuilder application.</li>
    <li><strong>Delphi 3 WebModules compatibility</strong> - you
        can use the standard Delphi 3 Content Producer classes
        with WebApp.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Components Support</strong> - With WebApp
        you can use <strong>any</strong> visual component (and
        not just TeeChart) to create images</li>
    <li><strong>BDE-friendly</strong> - The WebApp threading
        model is optimized for applications using the Borland
        Database Engine. WebApp make better use of BDE resources
        such as Sessions and Database Connections than
        applications based on Delphi's WebModules.</li>
</ul>

<p>WebApp supports ISAPI, NSAPI, WSAPI, CGI and WinCGI servers.
It also provides many routines and components which make Web
programming a lot easier, such as HTML generation components,
data-aware components, SMTP control for sending email, on-the-fly
conversion of bitmaps to GIF/JPEG, Ad-management component,
browser capabilities detection and a lot more.</p>

<h3>Here's what the professionals have to say about WebApp :</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I have already fallen in
    love with WebApp. This is just too cool. Delphi 3 makes ISAPI
    development much easier but why would I bang my head against
    the wall when I can have session management and all the other
    goodies that WebApp gives me?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Stephen Genusa</strong>
    - Consultant, maintainer of IIS, ASP and ISAPI FAQs, author
    of Que&#146;s <em>Special Edition Using ISAPI</em>.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You've really done an
    incredible job! I started on my application yesterday,and I
    think I'll be done by tomorrow. I was certain this project
    was going to take at least three weeks, not three days!
    Thanks for all your hard work... I really appreciate
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Steve Kramer</strong>
    [goog@goog.com]</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>WebApp applications run on top of <strong>any web server</strong>,
using the server's <em>native</em> interface. WebApp ships with
native support for Microsoft Internet Information Server (ISAPI),
Microsoft Personal Web Server (ISAPI), Netscape FastTrack
(NSAPI), O'reilly WebSite and WebSite Pro (WSAPI), as well as CGI
and Win-CGI interfaces which will work with any web server!</p>

<p>Put this great technology to work using WebApp's simple object
model (similar to and compatible with the model used in Microsoft
Active Server Pages). To get you started as quickly as possible,
we've included a variety of common components and sample
applications, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Browser Capabilities component, providing your
        applications with a description of the capabilities of
        the client's web browser</li>
    <li>Ad Rotator component, providing automated, controlled
        rotation of advertisement images.</li>
    <li>Data-aware HTML generation components and functions,
        simplifying the generation of complex HTML constructs,
        including generation of HTML tables from DB tables and
        queries.</li>
    <li>SMTP component, for sending email messages directly from
        your WebApp application</li>
</ul>
