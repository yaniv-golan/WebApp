	' No need to redisplay the form :%> This is the same HTML template which displayed the Form
previously. However, the embedded script detects that the form
was already submitted, and that all the fields were filled (Name
= <%=Request("NameText")%> and E-mail = <%=Request("EmailText")%>), so it doesn't display the form. This technique
enables us to centralize the entire form logic in one HTML
template. Of course, we could have another template or the Delphi
application handle the submitted form if we wanted.</p>
