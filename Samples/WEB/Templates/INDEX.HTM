<h1>WebApp Templates Demo</h1>

<p>BETA NOTE : This demo takes advantage of the WebApp Scripts
feature which is currently available only for Delphi 3.</p>

<p>This is a demonstration of the HTML template processing
capabilities of WebApp, as implemented by the WebApp <strong><tt>TWapTemplate</tt></strong>
component. </p>

<p>Each of the HTML templates in this demo contains embedded
Macros or WebApp Scripts. The entire processing and generation of
the HTML page takes place on the server side by the WebApp
application, therefore the user or the browser never see any
trace of these macros and scripts (select Document Source from
the View menu of your Netscape browser, or Source from the View
menu of your Internet Explorer, to see for yourself).</p>

<p>The standard footer at the bottom of these pages contains the
name of the HTML template from which the page was generated.
Also, if you click on the &quot;View Template Source&quot; link
at the bottom of the page, the WebApp application will display
the original HTML Template source, with the WebApp macros and
scripts marked in red color. This feature is available only in
this demo - your users will not be able to view the templates
source.</p>
