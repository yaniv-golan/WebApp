Document
---------
- Update HTML Form Controls, document individual controls
- Document Data aware controls
- TDatabase components, HandleShared
- Mention in what's new for PR5 : ContentProducer.Enabled was removed, as well as TWapApp.Serialize
- add ISAPI/NSAPI/CGI background
- Add list of HTML/HTTP refernces to the docs
- Talk in docs about debugging behaviour (\temp\cgixxxx.tmp for cgistub)
- Observation : PWS does not pass HTTP_ vars to the CGI interface! Therfore, CGI should not be used with PWS
- Talk in docs about how to store expired session information using an additional cookie
- CGI does not work with IIS, permissions problem
- WinCGI with Netscape server demands that the script and the temp directory are on the
 same drive, since the server does include the drive letter in the filenames

Install
-------
- Install the AppTemplate in Delphi
- Create server setup program
- Add .int versions of the source files
- Document Request.MapPath, Response.RequestBasicAuthorization, DecodeBasicAuthorization
- Document new components in htmltxt.pas, dbhtml.pas, add them to the comp. installation instructions

Next Version
-----------

- implement multipart form encoding
- Add TDBHtmlTRadioGroup
- Add TCustomHTMLBitmap, THTMLBitmap :See BITMAP.TXT for interface. Need to provide a way for action objects to determine their full name, including the module name.
- TWapModule and TWapSession should become TDataModule descendants
- Add to the HTMLFormControl : OnCustomize(HTMLTag: THTMLTag), where THTMLTag = Tag: string, Attributes: TStrings
- Add ISAPI optimization with delayed response
- Add mapping of script names to AppIDs (/App1Dir = App=App1)
- Expose URL decode/encode to the scripts
- Add premature UnlockSession
- App disable mechanism
- better exception handling
- Add Log() to server request interface
- Use Request.Log in the stub exception handling code
- Add Request.MapURL. What to do on CGI ???
- Figure out the REMOTE_USER, AUTH_USER stuff.
- Check if the limitation of each app requiring a differnt virtual path can be removed.
- Adjust the number of threads dynamically
- Make cleaner thread block instead of sleep
- Add remote controls to WebApp : start an application, stop an application, suspend, resume, check that an application is running
- product compare : Delphi 3 always cache the entire response, with WebApp this is optional. True ?
- The various locks in TWapSession can be removed since now sessions are always executed by the same thread
- Optimize the THttpReq interface. For example :
  - Move RemoteUser to have its own method.
- Check if WinCGI writes http "extra headers" as header-name or header_name, and fix wcgireq.pas to match.
- Change Macro syntax to Application.Macro, Session.Macro, Macro
- Optimize HAWebApp.DLL - 
	WapStub gets the WriteToClient info using a shared memory which is re-allocated on
	every write - should use a fixed size one.
- Put a limit on the number of requests in the queue
- TWapSession.FWaitingRequests is meaningless... it will always be one. It's TWapScheduler that should increment this.
- Action names - problems when renaming secondary modules...
- State saving
