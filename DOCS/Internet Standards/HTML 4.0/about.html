<h2><a name="h-1.1">1.1</a> How the specification is organized</h2>

<p>This specification is divided into the following sections:

<dl>
<dt><Strong>Sections 2 and 3: Introduction to HTML 4.0</strong>
<dd>The introduction describes HTML's place in the scheme of the World
Wide Web, provides a brief history of the development of HTML,
highlights what can be done with HTML 4.0, and provides some HTML
authoring tips.

<P>The brief SGML tutorial gives readers some understanding of 
HTML's relationship to SGML and gives summary information on how to
read the HTML Document Type Definition (DTD).
</dd>

<dt><strong>Sections 4 - 24: HTML 4.0 reference manual</strong>
<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the HTML language
reference, which defines all elements and attributes of the language.

<P>This document has been organized by topic rather than by the
grammar of HTML. Topics are grouped into three categories: structure,
presentation, and interactivity. Although it is not easy to divide
HTML constructs perfectly into these three categories, the model
reflects the HTML Working Group's experience that separating a
document's structure from its presentation produces more effective and
maintainable documents.

<P>The language reference consists of the following information:</P>

<ul>

<li><p>What <a href="charset.html#doc-char-set">characters</a> may
appear in an HTML document.</P>

<li><p>Basic <a href="types.html">data types</a> of an HTML document.</P>

<li><p>Elements that govern the structure of an HTML
document, including <a href="./struct/text.html">text</a>, <a
href="./struct/lists.html">lists</a>, 
<a href="./struct/tables.html">tables</a>, 
<a href="./struct/links.html">links</a>, and 
<a href="./struct/objects.html">included objects, images, and applets</a>.</P>

<li><p>Elements that govern the presentation of an HTML document,
including <a href="./present/styles.html">style sheets</a>, <a
href="./present/graphics.html">fonts, colors, rules, and other visual
presentation</a>, and <a href="./present/frames.html">frames for
multi-windowed presentations</a>.</P>

<li><p>Elements that govern interactivity with an HTML document,
including  <a href="./interact/forms.html">forms for user input</a> and
<a href="./interact/scripts.html">scripts for active documents</a>.</P>

<li><p>The SGML formal definition of HTML: 
<ul>
<li>The <a
href="./sgml/sgmldecl.html">SGML declaration of HTML</a>.
<li>Three DTDs: <a href="./sgml/dtd.html">strict</a>,
<a href="./sgml/loosedtd.html">transitional</a>, and 
<a href="./sgml/framesetdtd.html">frameset</a>.
<li>The <a
href="./sgml/entities.html">list of character references</a>.
</ul>
</ul>

<dt><strong>Appendixes</strong>

<dd>The first appendix contains information about <a
href="appendix/changes.html">changes from HTML 3.2</a> to help authors
and implementors with the transition to HTML 4.0, and <a
href="appendix/changes.html#19980424">changes from the 18 December 1997
specification</a>. The second appendix contains <a
href="appendix/notes.html">performance and implementation notes</a>, and is
primarily intended to help implementors create user agents for HTML 4.0.
</dd>

<dt><strong>References</strong>
<dd>A list of normative and informative references.</dd>

<dt><strong>Indexes</strong>

<dd>Three indexes give readers rapid access to the definition of key
<a href="./index/list.html">concepts</a>, <a
href="./index/elements.html">elements</a> and <a
href="./index/attributes.html">attributes</a>.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="h-1.2">1.2</a> Document conventions</H2>

<P>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
authors and implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without over-exposing them to
HTML's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build conforming user agents.

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:

<ul>
<li><P><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification
begins with a general presentation of HTML and becomes more and more
technical and specific towards the end.

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get
information about 
syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the online
version of the specification includes the following
features:

<ol>
<li>Every reference to an element or attribute is linked to
its definition in the specification. Each element or attribute
is defined in only one location.

<li>Every page includes links to the indexes, so you never are
more than two links away from finding the definition of an <a
href="index/elements.html">element</a> or <a
href="index/attributes.html">attribute</a>.

<li><p>The front pages of the three sections of the language reference
manual extend the initial table of contents with more
detail about each section.</P>

</ol>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h-1.2.1">1.2.1</a> Elements and attributes</h3>

<P> Element names are written in uppercase letters (e.g.,
BODY). Attribute names are written in lowercase letters (e.g., lang,
onsubmit). Recall that in HTML, element and attribute names are
case-insensitive; the convention is meant to encourage readability.

<p>Element and attribute names in this document have been marked up
and may be rendered specially by some user agents.

<p>Each attribute definition specifies the type of its value. If
the type allows a small set of possible values, the definition
lists the set of values, separated by a bar (|).

<P>After the type information, each attribute definition indicates the
case-sensitivity of its values, between square brackets ("[]").  See
the section on <a href="types.html#case">case information</a> for
details.

<h3><a name="h-1.2.2">1.2.2</a> Notes and examples</h3>

<P>Informative notes are emphasized to stand out from surrounding
text and may be rendered specially by some user agents.

<P>All examples illustrating <a
href="conform.html#deprecated">deprecated</a> usage are marked as
"DEPRECATED EXAMPLE". Deprecated examples also include recommended
alternate solutions. All examples that illustrates illegal usage are
clearly marked "ILLEGAL EXAMPLE".

<P>Examples and notes have been marked up and may be rendered
specially by some user agents.
