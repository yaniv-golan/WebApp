<h1>HyperAct releases WebApp Preview 3</h1>

<h3><em>Web server applications, the RAD way!</em></h3>

<h3><em>For Delphi 2, Delphi 3 and C++Builder</em></h3>

<hr>

<p>DES MOINES, IOWA, <strong>June 5, 1997</strong> - HyperAct,
Inc., a leading provider of Web tools and Applications, announced
the release of WebApp Preview 3. WebApp is a new and exciting
framework that provides web programmers with the building blocks
they need to build great web applications today!</p>

<h3>WebApp Features :</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Server Independent</strong> - a WebApp Server
        Application can run unmodified, without re-compilation,
        on top of any Web server!</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Session Management</strong> - The
        WebApp framework implements transparent cookies-based
        session state management, keeping track of your users for
        you.</li>
    <li><strong>High performance</strong> - WebApp Server
        Applications are fully multi-threaded, employing thread
        pooling to maximize the utilization of the server
        resources. </li>
    <li><strong>HTML Templates - </strong>WebApp provides
        integrated support for HTML templates, facilitating
        seperation between the application logic and the HTML
        Frontend.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-side Scripts - </strong>WebApp templates
        are driven with inlined VBScript and JScript scripts,
        providing unparalled power and flexibilty to the template
        authors and easy integration with the WebApp Delphi /
        CBuilder application.</li>
    <li><strong>Safe</strong> - WebApp Server Applications run in
        a separate process from the server, eliminating the risk
        for a server crash!</li>
    <li><strong>Easy Debugging</strong> - Live WebApp
        applications can be debugged easily from within the
        Delphi or C++Builder environment, without requiring a
        restart of the server. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Here's what the professionals have to say about WebApp :</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I have already fallen in
    love with WebApp. This is just too cool. Delphi 3 makes ISAPI
    development much easier but why would I bang my head against
    the wall when I can have session management and all the other
    goodies that WebApp gives me?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Stephen Genusa</strong>
    - Consultant, maintainer of IIS, ASP and ISAPI FAQs, author
    of Que&#146;s <em>Special Edition Using ISAPI</em>.</font> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>WebApp applications run on top of <strong>any web server</strong>,
using the server's <em>native</em> interface. WebApp ships with
native support for Microsoft Internet Information Server (ISAPI),
Microsoft Personal Web Server (ISAPI), Netscape FastTrack
(NSAPI), O'reilly WebSite and WebSite Pro (WSAPI), as well as CGI
and Win-CGI interfaces which will work with any web server!</p>

<p>Put this great technology to work using WebApp's simple object
model (similar to and compatible with the model used in Microsoft
Active Server Pages). To get you started as quickly as possible,
we've included a variety of common components and sample
applications, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Browser Capabilities component, providing your
        applications with a description of the capabilities of
        the client's web browser</li>
    <li>Ad Rotator component, providing automated, controlled
        rotation of advertisement images.</li>
    <li>HTML generation components and functions, simplifying the
        generation of complex HTML constructs, including
        generation of HTML tables from DB tables and queries.</li>
    <li>Conversion of bitmaps to GIF/JPEG on the fly</li>
</ul>

<p>A beta version of WebApp is available for <a
