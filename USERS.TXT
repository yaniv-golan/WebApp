   "I have already fallen in love with WebApp. This is just too cool. Delphi 3 makes 
   ISAPI development much easier but why would I bang my head against the wall when 
   I can have session management and all the other goodies that WebApp gives me?"

   "You've really done an incredible job! I started on my application yesterday, 
   and I think   I'll be done by tomorrow. I was certain this project was going to 
   take at least three weeks, not three days! Thanks for all your hard work... 
   I really appreciate it."

   "I just wanted to write an congratulate you on a fine product...I've been
   using the latest beta version of WebApp and must say that it makes life
   easy.  Thanks and keep up the great work."
